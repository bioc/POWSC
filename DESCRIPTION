Description:Determining the sample size for adequate power to detect statistical significance is a crucial step at the design stage for high-throughput experiments. 
            Even though a number of methods and tools are available for sample size calculation for microarray and RNA-seq in the context of differential expression (DE), 
            this topic in the field of single-cell RNA sequencing is understudied. Moreover, the unique data characteristics present in scRNA-seq such as sparsity and heterogeneity increase the challenge. 
            We propose POWSC, a simulation-based method, to provide power evaluation and sample size recommendation for single-cell RNA sequencing DE analysis. 
            POWSC consists of a data simulator that creates realistic expression data, and a power assessor that provides a comprehensive evaluation 
            and visualization of the power and sample size relationship.
